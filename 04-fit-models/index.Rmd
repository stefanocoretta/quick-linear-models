# Summary from last time

* The simplest .orange[**linear model**] is a straight line.

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$

* We want to estimate the $\beta_n$ .orange[**coefficients**].

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3$$

* Categorical predictors are .orange[dummy coded].

* .orange[**Interactions**] model differences of the effects of the predictors on the outcome across groups/conditions.

# Think about the probability distribution of the outcome variable

---

# Continuous outcome variable

* The variable can take on *any positive and negative real number, including 0*: **Gaussian** (aka normal) distribution.

    * There are very few truly Gaussian variables, although in some cases one can speak of "approximate" or "assumed" normality.

    * This family is fitted by default in `lm()`, `lme4::lmer()` and `brms::brm()`.

--

* The variable can take on *any positive number only*: **Log-normal** distribution.

    * Duration of segments, words, pauses, etc, are known to be log-normally distributed.

    * Measurements taken in Hz (like f0, formants, centre of gravity, ...) could be considered to be log-normal.

    * There other families that could potentially be used depending on the nature of the variable: exponential-Gaussian (reaction times), gamma, ...

---

# Continuous outcome variable

* The variable can take on *any number between 0 and 1, but not 0 nor 1*: **Beta** distribution.

    * Proportions fall into this category (for example proportion of voicing within closure), although 0 and 1 are not allowed in the beta distribution.

--

* The variable can take on *any number between 0 and 1, including 0 or 0 and 1*: **Zero-inflated** or **Zero/one-inflated beta** (ZOIB) distribution.

    * If the proportion data includes many 0s and 1s, then this is the ideal distribution to use. ZOIB distributions are somewhat more difficult to fit than a simple beta distribution, so a common practice is to transform the data so that it doesn't include 0s nor 1s (this can be achieved using different techniques, some better than others).

---

# Discrete outcome variable

* The variable is *counts*: **Poisson** distribution.

    * Counts of words, segments, gestures, f0 peaks, ...
    
--

* The variable is *dichotomous*, i.e. it can take one of two levels: **Bernoulli** distribution.

    * Categorical outcome variables like yes/no, correct/incorrect, voiced/voiceless, follow this distribution.

    * This family is fitted by default when you run `glm(family = binomial)`, aka "logistic regression" or "binomial regression".

--

* The variable is a *scale*: **ordinal** linear model.

    * Likert scales and ratings, language attitude questionnaires.

    * Ordinal linear models, a.k.a. ordinal logistic regression, can be fitted with the [ordinal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ordinal/index.html) and the [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) package.

# From log-odds to odds: Examples

- 10 mo infants perform on average 10 iconic gestures per day. At 11 mo, the number of gestures increases by a factor of 1.6. At 12 mo, there is a further increase by a factor of 1.2.

--

  - Calculate the average number of gestures per day at 12 months based on the 10 month average (10 gestures).

--

- The average number of errors L2 learners make decreases by a factor of 0.2 every year and a half.

--

  - Calculate the average number of errors after 6 years, assuming 265 errors at year 1.
